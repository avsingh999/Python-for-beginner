## Radix Sort

## Statement:
Given a disordered list of integers, rearrange them in natural order.
Sample Input: [18,5,100,3,1,19,6,0,7,4,2]
Sample Output: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,18,19,100]

Time Complexity of Solution:
-Best Case O(kn)
-Average Case O(kn)
-Worst Case O(kn),
where k is the length of the longest number and n is the size of the input array.

Note: if k is greater than log(n) then an nlog(n) algorithm would be a better fit. In reality we can always change the radix to make k less than log(n).

## Approach:
Radix sort, like counting sort and bucket sort, is an integer based algorithm (i.e. the values of the input array are assumed
to be integers). Hence radix sort is among the fastest sorting algorithms around, in theory. The particular distinction for radix sort is
that it creates a bucket for each cipher (i.e. digit); as such, similar to bucket sort, each bucket in radix sort must be a growable list 
that may admit different keys.

For decimal values, the number of buckets is 10, as the decimalsystem has 10 numerals/cyphers (i.e. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). Then the 
keys are continuously sorted by significant digits.

## Code

    def radixsort( aList ):
        RADIX = 10
        maxLength = False
        tmp , placement = -1, 1
        
        while not maxLength:
            maxLength = True
            # declare and initialize buckets
            buckets = [list() for _ in range( RADIX )]
     
        # split aList between lists
        for  i in aList:
          tmp = i / placement
          buckets[tmp % RADIX].append( i )
          if maxLength and tmp > 0:
            maxLength = False
     
        # empty lists into aList array
        a = 0
        for b in range( RADIX ):
          buck = buckets[b]
          for i in buck:
            aList[a] = i
            a += 1
     
        # move to next digit
        placement *= RADIX
