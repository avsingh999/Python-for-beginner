# Python Code that Displays Addition, Subtraction, Division and Multiplication of 2 numbers
## Initializing Variables `x` and `y` as `10` and `5` respectively
```python
x = 10
y = 5
```

## Basic operators only requirement is having 2 variables with the operator symbol between

### Addition example
```python
add = x + y
```

### Subtraction example
```python
sub = x - y
```

### Division example
```python
div = x / y
```

### Multiplication example
```python
mul = x * y
```

## Printing out the results
```python
print(f'Addition of {x} and {y} is {add}')
print(f'Subtraction of {x} and {y} is {sub}')
print(f'Division of {x} and {y} is {div}')
print(f'Multiplication of {x} and {y} is {mul}')
```

### Output:
    Addition of 10 and 5 is 15
    Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5
    Division of 10 and 5 is 2.0
    Multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50
