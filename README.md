Python is an object-oriented programming language created by Guido Rossum in 1989. It is ideally designed for rapid prototyping of complex applications. It has interfaces to many OS system calls and libraries, and is extensible to C or C++. Many large companies use the Python programming language, including NASA, Google, YouTube, BitTorrent, etc.
Python is widely used in Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Generation, Neural Networks, and other advanced fields in Computer Science. Python has a deep focus on code readability & this class will teach you python from the basics.
